# ðŸŒŽ Flag Guesser API (Spring)

A simple Guess the Flag game backend built with Spring Framework.
It randomly fetches country data, and lets users guess which country's flag is shown.

## Stack

- Java 21+
- Spring Boot
- Caffeine Cache
- REST Countries API (https://restcountries.com)
- Lombok

## Game Logic

- `/generate` â€“ Starts a new game by returning a flag svg and a unique code to identify the session.
- `/guess` â€“ You send your guess, and the API tells if you're right or wrong.

Each game expires in **60 seconds**.

## ðŸ§ª API Endpoints
